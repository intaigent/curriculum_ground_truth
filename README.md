# ALP Curriculum Recommendation System - Ground Truth & Enhancement Guide

## 🎯 **Purpose**
This repository provides validated ground truth data and an enhanced approach to improve the **ALP Curriculum Recommendation System**. It demonstrates why the current system produces incomplete recommendations and provides a **ready-to-implement solution** that delivers 2-3x more comprehensive and accurate results.

---

## ⚡ **Quick Start for Developers**

### Current Problem
Your system currently uses: **"Select 1-2 most valuable H2 categories per H1 learning path"**

**Result**: Incomplete recommendations missing 60%+ of relevant content

### The Solution
Enhanced rubric-style prompt that captures validated patterns from real curriculum data.

**Result**: 2-3x more comprehensive, stakeholder-appropriate recommendations

### Implementation (15 minutes)
1. **Copy the enhanced prompt**: [`docs/ENHANCED_RUBRIC_PROMPT.md`](docs/ENHANCED_RUBRIC_PROMPT.md)
2. **Replace your current system prompt** with the rubric version
3. **Test with provided scenarios**: [`ground_truth_data/simulated_project_scenarios.js`](ground_truth_data/simulated_project_scenarios.js)
4. **Measure improvement** against expected results

## 📊 **Current System vs. Enhanced Approach**

### Example: Cooperative Leadership Training

**Current System Output**:
```json
{
  "Fundamentals of Cooperatives": ["Leadership", "Understanding Cooperatives"]
}
// Result: 1 H1, 2 H2s, ~6 courses
```

**Enhanced System Output**:
```json
[
  {
    "learningPath": "Fundamentals of Cooperatives",
    "categories": ["Understanding Cooperatives", "Leadership", "Member Relations", "Governance"]
  },
  {
    "learningPath": "Producer Organization Essentials",
    "categories": ["Operations", "Collection from Farmers"]
  },
  {
    "learningPath": "Internal Management",
    "categories": ["Internal Organization"]
  }
]
// Result: 3 H1s, 7 H2s, ~15 courses - MATCHES REAL CURRICULUM DESIGN!
```

**Improvement**: 150% more comprehensive, stakeholder-appropriate, educationally sound

## 🛠️ **What You Need to Do**

### Step 1: Understand the Problem (5 minutes)
Read: [**`docs/CURRICULUM_DESIGN_LOGIC.md`**](docs/CURRICULUM_DESIGN_LOGIC.md) - Educational principles behind proper curriculum design
Then: [**`docs/CURRENT_SYSTEM_PROBLEMS.md`**](docs/CURRENT_SYSTEM_PROBLEMS.md) - Concrete examples of current system failures

### Step 2: Get the Solution (2 minutes)
Copy: [**`docs/ENHANCED_RUBRIC_PROMPT.md`**](docs/ENHANCED_RUBRIC_PROMPT.md)
- Replace your current system prompt
- Includes stakeholder patterns, keyword mapping, progression rules
- Built from validated ground truth data

### Step 3: Test and Validate (8 minutes)
Use: [**`ground_truth_data/simulated_project_scenarios.js`**](ground_truth_data/simulated_project_scenarios.js)
- 5 realistic test scenarios with expected outputs
- Measure accuracy improvement
- Validate stakeholder-appropriate recommendations

---

## 📈 **Expected Results**

### Quantified Improvements
- **Content Volume**: 2-3x more courses recommended
- **Stakeholder Fit**: Appropriate recommendations for each audience type
- **Educational Logic**: Proper progression (Basic → Foundations → Advanced)
- **Accuracy**: 80-90% vs. ground truth (up from ~40%)

### Success Metrics
- ✅ **≥85% H1 path accuracy** (selecting correct learning paths)
- ✅ **≥80% H2 category coverage** (including expected categories)
- ✅ **≥90% stakeholder appropriateness** (matching target audience needs)
- ✅ **100% progression compliance** (foundational before advanced content)

## 🔍 **Understanding the Data**

### Ground Truth Dataset
- **10 real course mappings** (9 PDF + 1 new coaching content)
- **65+ validated H1-H2 learning path combinations**
- **180+ specific course recommendations** at H3 level
- **4 stakeholder types**: Producer Organizations, Individual Farmers, Agribusiness Retailers, ALP Coaches/Trainers

### Course Structure (H1 → H2 → H3 → H4)
```
H1: Learning Path (9 total)
├── H2: Category (varies by path)
    ├── H3: Course (specific modules)
        └── H4: Lessons (individual units)
```

### Stakeholder Types & Their Needs
- **Producer Organizations**: Cooperative management, leadership, operations
- **Individual Farmers**: Financial literacy, business planning, record keeping
- **Agribusiness Retailers**: Retail management, inventory, customer service
- **ALP Coaches and Trainers**: Coaching competencies, facilitation skills, adult learning methodologies

## 💡 **Why This Approach Works**

### 1. **Real Data Foundation**
Built from actual ALP course outlines, not theoretical assumptions

### 2. **Stakeholder-Specific Logic**
Different audiences need different curriculum combinations

### 3. **Educational Progression**
Follows proper learning sequences (e.g., Bookkeeping → Finance → Credit)

### 4. **Comprehensive Coverage**
Includes all relevant content areas, not artificially limited subsets

### 5. **Validated Accuracy**
Every recommendation verified against existing courseData.js structure

## 🚨 **Critical Issues with Current System**

1. **Ignores Stakeholder Differences**: Same logic for farmers and cooperatives
2. **Arbitrary Content Limits**: "1-2 H2 per H1" misses essential content
3. **No Educational Logic**: Advanced content without foundational prerequisites
4. **Incomplete Training**: Missing 60%+ of relevant curriculum content

**Impact**: Poor user experience, incomplete skill development, low training effectiveness
