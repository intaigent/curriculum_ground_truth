#### **For Ground Truth Dataset Enhancement:**

4. **Context-Specific Mappings**: Create separate categories for trainer vs. participant content

#### **For courseData.js Development:**
1. **Add Agriculture-Specific Modules**: Farm business calculations, agricultural pricing
2. **Enhance HR Management**: Advanced staff policies and performance systems
3. **Expand Cost Accounting**: Break-even analysis, contribution margins
4. **Trainer Resources**: Consider separate learning path for facilitation skills

#### **For AI Model Training:**
1. **Coverage Limitations**: Document that 25% of PDF content has no courseData.js equivalent
2. **Specialized Contexts**: Flag when recommendations may need external/supplementary content
3. **Alternative Suggestions**: Develop fallback recommendations for unmapped content
