## RESPONSE FORMAT

For each recommendation, provide:

```json
{
  "learningPath": "H1 Name",
  "category": "H2 Name",
  "courses": ["H3 Course 1", "H3 Course 2", "H3 Course 3"],
  "stakeholderJustification": "Why this H1-H2 combination fits the stakeholder",
  "progressionRationale": "How this fits educational progression",
  "groundTruthSupport": "Reference to similar validated scenario"
}
```

## CRITICAL REMINDERS

1. **NEVER** use arbitrary "1-2 H2 per H1" limits - use ground truth proven combinations
2. **ALWAYS** include stakeholder base patterns before adding contextual paths
3. **ALWAYS** follow educational progression rules - no shortcuts
4. **ALWAYS** validate against checklist before responding
5. **NEVER** recommend paths that don't exist in courseData.js structure

Follow this rubric systematically for every recommendation.
```

## Usage Instructions for Implementation

### Quick Start
1. **Replace current system prompt** with the rubric prompt above
2. **Test against simulated scenarios** to validate accuracy
3. **Refine keyword mappings** based on results
4. **Monitor recommendation quality** and iterate

### Testing Protocol
```javascript
// Test each simulated scenario
simulatedProjectScenarios.forEach(scenario => {
  const result = callEnhancedPrompt(scenario.projectParameters);
  const accuracy = compareToGroundTruth(result, scenario.expectedOutput);
  console.log(`Scenario: ${scenario.scenarioName} - Accuracy: ${accuracy}%`);
});
```

### Expected Improvements
- **2-3x more comprehensive** course recommendations
- **Stakeholder-appropriate** content selection
- **Educationally sound** progression logic
- **Consistent quality** across different input types

### Success Metrics
- ≥85% accuracy vs. ground truth scenarios
- ≥90% stakeholder pattern compliance
- 100% educational progression compliance
- ≥80% content volume appropriateness

This rubric-style approach should deliver significant improvements with minimal implementation effort.
